### Paraphrenia

Paraphrenia is a 2 player online co-op Horror Puzzle game with asymmetrical gameplay.

### Gameplay

Paraphrenia is played online, with two players. Both players play a different role in the game. The first player plays a Mental Health Patient, called Edith Hall. The patient is restrained in a wheelchair. The Patient has the ability to look trough the ghost's eyes and can see paranormal activity, which they must communicate to the second player in order to solve puzzles. The second player plays a Nurse. The nurse can move the wheelchair around and ask the patient questions through "in-game" chat, though they can also walk around alone. The player's need to communicate with eachother to solve the various puzzles found in the Psych ward.

### Horror Story

This game takes place in 1997 America, in an old Psych Ward. There is a ghost haunting the building that only the Patient can see, because of their personal connection to the ghost. The ghost tries to drive the patient insane, and will not shy away from violence and deceit to do so. During the game, the Patient needs to warn the Nurse to hide from the ghost's attacks. The ghost also moves objects, including the Patient's wheelchair.
