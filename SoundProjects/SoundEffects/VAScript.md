### Cutscene 1: Intro
Flashback. Siamese twins talk to each other, you hear music from a music box, and hear the twins sing along. Flash forward to today, and you see the nurse enter the building. It's his first day. He walks to the patient's room, and gets her out into the hallway. Right as he does, alarms sound, and after a short delay, the lights go out.

### Side puzzle: Back into the patient's room
Going back into the room, the patient hears a faint rustling noise in the corner. If the nurse looks in that corner, they can find a letter written by the patient, describing how she misses her little sister.

### Puzzle one: Check power
Navigate to the electrical room nearby. In the room there are warning lights blinking everywhere, in a 4-color code only the patient can see. The nurse must connect the wires in that order. Connecting them correctly turns the power back on.
*Designer's Note: The wires are colored white, orange, yellow and blue. The nurse can see the warning lights all red, and connecting the correct wire turns one of the lights green. Connecting the wrong wire causes a surge that breaks all wires*

### Get the Patient's meds
The patient needs her medication before leaving. The players look for a map of the asylum, and find the medicine storage room on the map. While navigating through the hallways to the storage rooms, the patient sees movement in the corridors, and hears whispers. You arrive at the storage room. There you must find the right meds.

### Puzzle two: Find the right medication
The patient can see a bloody message written on the wall. This message is written in code, of which the nurse can see one half of the decipher key, while the patient can see the other half. Together they find the name of the medicine they need to grab and give to the patient.
*Designer's note: We sometimes want the nurse to also see things, which the patient cannot. More puzzle options*

### Move towards the exit
While moving to the exit, you find your path blocked by an electronic door, and you find blood on the floor. The door requires a keycard. There is a thick trail of blood leading away from the door that only the patient can see, which leads to the IT room.

### Side puzzle: Therapist room
One of the side rooms you hide in is the room of the therapist that treats the patient. Hidden in a corner is a key, which can be used to open cabinet drawers. The patient can see a knife stuck in the drawer you need to open. In there you can find a medical document describing an operation on a Siamese twin.

### Puzzle three: Confinement room
One of the side rooms turns out to be the confinement room, which locks upon closing the door. Inside there's a mechanism to open the door, but it requires a passcode. On the wall is a note saying that the passcode is "The start of each drawing." On the walls are some children's drawings. One is a drawing of Hands, one is Eyes, one is Lips, one is of a Pizza. Together they spell HELP, which opens the door.

### Puzzle four: IT room
Inside the IT room there's a locked side room. In the IT room there are a bunch of computers, floppy disks, as well as a few electric alarm clocks. When near one of the clocks, the clock's alarm starts beeping. Only the patient can hear which clock is beeping. If any player looks at the clock, they can see a 4-digit code to enter into the side room keypad to open the room. Inside the room is a keycard.
*Designer's note: We wanted to do more than just player A seeing and player B doing. Hearing is a nice alternative to seeing.*

### Side puzzle: IT Room optional cutscene
While the nurse is in the side room, the patient hears the ghost talking in their ear, telling them to look for a green floppy disk and to turn on the PC inside of the side room. Inserting the floppy disk into the PC opens a newspaper article about a fire killing two parents of a pair of Siamese twins, with it being confirmed as arson but there being no suspects.
